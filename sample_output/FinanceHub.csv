A time series is a set of observations on a variable’s outcomes in different time periods: the quarterly sales for a particular company during the past five years, for example, or the daily returns on a traded security. In this reading, we explore the two chief uses of time-series models: to explain the past and to predict the future of a time series. We also discuss how to estimate time-series models, and we examine how a model describing a particular time series can change over time. The following two examples illustrate the kinds of questions we might want to ask about time series. Suppose it is the beginning of 2020 and we are managing a US-based investment portfolio that includes Swiss stocks. Because the value of this portfolio would decrease if the Swiss franc depreciates with respect to the dollar, and vice versa, holding all else constant, we are considering whether to hedge the portfolio’s exposure to changes in the value of the franc. To help us in making this decision, we decide to model the time series of the franc/dollar exchange rate. Exhibit 1 shows monthly data on the franc/dollar exchange rate. The data are monthly averages of daily exchange rates. Has the exchange rate been more stable since 1987 than it was in previous years? Has the exchange rate shown a long-term trend? How can we best use past exchange rates to predict future exchange rates? As another example, suppose it is the beginning of 2020. We cover retail stores for a sell-side firm and want to predict retail sales for the coming year. Exhibit 2 shows monthly data on US retail sales. The data are not seasonally adjusted, hence the spikes around the holiday season at the turn of each year. Because the reported sales in the stores’ financial statements are not seasonally adjusted, we model seasonally unadjusted retail sales. How can we model the trend in retail sales? How can we adjust for the extreme seasonality reflected in the peaks and troughs occurring at regular intervals? How can we best use past retail sales to predict future retail sales? Some fundamental questions arise in time-series analysis: How do we model trends? How do we predict the future value of a time series based on its past values? How do we model seasonality? How do we choose among time-series models? And how do we model changes in the variance of time series over time? We address each of these issues in this reading. We first describe typical challenges in applying the linear regression model to time-series data. We present linear and log-linear trend models, which describe, respectively, the value and the natural log of the value of a time series as a linear function of time. We then present autoregressive time-series models—which explain the current value of a time series in terms of one or more lagged values of the series. Such models are among the most commonly used in investments, and the section addresses many related concepts and issues. We then turn our attention to random walks. Because such time series are not covariance stationary, they cannot be modeled using autoregressive models unless they can be transformed into stationary series. We therefore explore appropriate transformations and tests of stationarity. The subsequent sections address moving-average time-series models and discuss the problem of seasonality in time series and how to address it. We also cover autoregressive moving-average models, a more complex alternative to autoregressive models. The last two topics are modeling changing variance of the error term in a time series and the consequences of regression of one time series on another when one or both time series may not be covariance stationary.","The member should be able to: calculate and evaluate the predicted trend value for a time series, modeled as either a linear trend or a log-linear trend, given the estimated trend coefficients; describe factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear trend should be used with a particular time series and evaluate limitations of trend models; explain the requirement for a time series to be covariance stationary and describe the significance of a series that is not stationary; describe the structure of an autoregressive (AR) model of order p and calculate one- and two-period-ahead forecasts given the estimated coefficients; explain how autocorrelations of the residuals can be used to test whether the autoregressive model fits the time series; explain mean reversion and calculate a mean-reverting level; contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and compare the forecasting accuracy of different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion; explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models; describe characteristics of random walk processes and contrast them to covariance stationary processes; describe implications of unit roots for time-series analysis, explain when unit roots are likely to occur and how to test for them, and demonstrate how a time series with a unit root can be transformed so it can be analyzed with an AR model; describe the steps of the unit root test for nonstationarity and explain the relation of the test to autoregressive time-series models; explain how to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model and calculate and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a seasonal lag; explain autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe how ARCH models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series; explain how time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration before use in a linear regression; and determine an appropriate time-series model to analyze a given investment problem and justify that choice.","The predicted trend value of a time series in period t is b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 t in a linear trend model; the predicted trend value of a time series in a log-linear trend model is e b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 t . Time series that tend to grow by a constant amount from period to period should be modeled by linear trend models, whereas time series that tend to grow at a constant rate should be modeled by log-linear trend models. Trend models often do not completely capture the behavior of a time series, as indicated by serial correlation of the error term. If the Durbin–Watson statistic from a trend model differs significantly from 2, indicating serial correlation, we need to build a different kind of model. An autoregressive model of order p, denoted AR( p ), uses p lags of a time series to predict its current value: x t = b 0 + b 1 x t −1 + b 2 x t −2 + . . . + b p x t – p + ε t . A time series is covariance stationary if the following three conditions are satisfied: First, the expected value of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Second, the variance of the time series must be constant and finite in all periods. Third, the covariance of the time series with itself for a fixed number of periods in the past or future must be constant and finite in all periods. Inspection of a nonstationary time-series plot may reveal an upward or downward trend (nonconstant mean) and/or nonconstant variance. The use of linear regression to estimate an autoregressive time-series model is not valid unless the time series is covariance stationary. For a specific autoregressive model to be a good fit to the data, the autocorrelations of the error term should be 0 at all lags. A time series is mean reverting if it tends to fall when its level is above its long-run mean and rise when its level is below its long-run mean. If a time series is covariance stationary, then it will be mean reverting. The one-period-ahead forecast of a variable x t from an AR(1) model made in period t for period t + 1 is x ‸ t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t . This forecast can be used to create the two-period-ahead forecast from the model made in period t , x ‸ t + 2 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + 1 . Similar results hold for AR( p ) models. In-sample forecasts are the in-sample predicted values from the estimated time-series model. Out-of-sample forecasts are the forecasts made from the estimated time-series model for a time period different from the one for which the model was estimated. Out-of-sample forecasts are usually more valuable in evaluating the forecasting performance of a time-series model than are in-sample forecasts. The root mean squared error (RMSE), defined as the square root of the average squared forecast error, is a criterion for comparing the forecast accuracy of different time-series models; a smaller RMSE implies greater forecast accuracy. Just as in regression models, the coefficients in time-series models are often unstable across different sample periods. In selecting a sample period for estimating a time-series model, we should seek to assure ourselves that the time series was stationary in the sample period. A random walk is a time series in which the value of the series in one period is the value of the series in the previous period plus an unpredictable random error. If the time series is a random walk, it is not covariance stationary. A random walk with drift is a random walk with a nonzero intercept term. All random walks have unit roots. If a time series has a unit root, then it will not be covariance stationary. If a time series has a unit root, we can sometimes transform the time series into one that is covariance stationary by first-differencing the time series; we may then be able to estimate an autoregressive model for the first-differenced series. An n -period moving average of the current and past ( n − 1) values of a time series, x t , is calculated as [ x t + x t −1 + . . . + x t −( n −1) ]/ n . A moving-average model of order q , denoted MA( q ), uses q lags of a random error term to predict its current value. The order q of a moving-average model can be determined using the fact that if a time series is a moving-average time series of order q, its first q autocorrelations are nonzero while autocorrelations beyond the first q are zero. The autocorrelations of most autoregressive time series start large and decline gradually, whereas the autocorrelations of an MA( q ) time series suddenly drop to 0 after the first q autocorrelations. This helps in distinguishing between autoregressive and moving-average time series. If the error term of a time-series model shows significant serial correlation at seasonal lags, the time series has significant seasonality. This seasonality can often be modeled by including a seasonal lag in the model, such as adding a term lagged four quarters to an AR(1) model on quarterly observations. The forecast made in time t for time t + 1 using a quarterly AR(1) model with a seasonal lag would be x t + 1 = b ‸ 0 + b ‸ 1 x t + b ‸ 2 x t − 3 . ARMA models have several limitations: The parameters in ARMA models can be very unstable; determining the AR and MA order of the model can be difficult; and even with their additional complexity, ARMA models may not forecast well. The variance of the error in a time-series model sometimes depends on the variance of previous errors, representing autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH). Analysts can test for first-order ARCH in a time-series model by regressing the squared residual on the squared residual from the previous period. If the coefficient on the squared residual is statistically significant, the time-series model has ARCH(1) errors. If a time-series model has ARCH(1) errors, then the variance of the errors in period t + 1 can be predicted in period t using the formula σ ‸ t + 1 2 = a ‸ 0 + a ‸ 1 ε ‸ t 2 . If linear regression is used to model the relationship between two time series, a test should be performed to determine whether either time series has a unit root: If neither of the time series has a unit root, then we can safely use linear regression. If one of the two time series has a unit root, then we should not use linear regression. If both time series have a unit root and the time series are cointegrated, we may safely use linear regression; however, if they are not cointegrated, we should not use linear regression. The (Engle–Granger) Dickey–Fuller test can be used to determine whether time series are cointegrated.

Our coverage will go over important concepts, tools, and applications of credit analysis. We first look at modeling credit risk. The inputs to credit risk modeling are the expected exposure to default loss, the loss given default, and the probability of default. We explain these terms and use a numerical example to illustrate the calculation of the credit valuation adjustment for a corporate bond and its credit spread over a government bond yield taken as a proxy for a default-risk-free rate (or default-free rate). We then discuss credit scoring and credit ratings. Credit scoring is a measure of credit risk used in retail loan markets, and ratings are used in the wholesale bond market. We explain two types of credit analysis models used in practice—structural models and reduced-form models. Both models are highly mathematical and beyond the scope of our coverage. Therefore, we provide only an overview to highlight the key ideas and the similarities and differences between them. We then use the arbitrage-free framework and a binomial interest rate tree to value risky fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds for different assumptions about interest rate volatility. We also build on the credit risk model to interpret changes in credit spreads that arise from changes in the assumed probability of default, the recovery rate, or the exposure to default loss. We also explain the term structure of credit spreads and finally compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt with the credit analysis of corporate bonds.","The member should be able to: explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment; explain credit scores and credit ratings; calculate the expected return on a bond given transition in its credit rating; explain structural and reduced-form models of corporate credit risk, including assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses; calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters; interpret changes in a credit spread; explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads; compare the credit analysis required for securitized debt to the credit analysis of corporate debt.","This reading has covered several important topics in credit analysis. Among the points made are the following: Three factors important to modeling credit risk are the expected exposure to default, the recovery rate, and the loss given default. These factors permit the calculation of a credit valuation adjustment that is subtracted from the (hypothetical) value of the bond, if it were default risk free, to get the bond’s fair value given its credit risk. The credit valuation adjustment is calculated as the sum of the present values of the expected loss for each period in the remaining life of the bond. Expected values are computed using risk-neutral probabilities, and discounting is done at the risk-free rates for the relevant maturities. The CVA captures investors’ compensation for bearing default risk. The compensation can also be expressed in terms of a credit spread. Credit scores and credit ratings are third-party evaluations of creditworthiness used in distinct markets. Analysts may use credit ratings and a transition matrix of probabilities to adjust a bond’s yield-to-maturity to reflect the probabilities of credit migration. Credit spread migration typically reduces expected return. Credit analysis models fall into two broad categories: structural models and reduced-form models. Structural models are based on an option perspective of the positions of the stakeholders of the company. Bondholders are viewed as owning the assets of the company; shareholders have call options on those assets. Reduced-form models seek to predict when a default may occur, but they do not explain the why as do structural models. Reduced-form models, unlike structural models, are based only on observable variables. When interest rates are assumed to be volatile, the credit risk of a bond can be estimated in an arbitrage-free valuation framework. The discount margin for floating-rate notes is similar to the credit spread for fixed-coupon bonds. The discount margin can also be calculated using an arbitrage-free valuation framework. Arbitrage-free valuation can be applied to judge the sensitivity of the credit spread to changes in credit risk parameters. The term structure of credit spreads depends on macro and micro factors. As it concerns macro factors, the credit spread curve tends to become steeper and widen in conditions of weak economic activity. Market supply and demand dynamics are important. The most frequently traded securities tend to determine the shape of this curve. Issuer- or industry-specific factors, such as the chance of a future leverage-decreasing event, can cause the credit spread curve to flatten or invert. When a bond is very likely to default, it often trades close to its recovery value at various maturities; moreover, the credit spread curve is less informative about the relationship between credit risk and maturity. For securitized debt, the characteristics of the asset portfolio themselves suggest the best approach for a credit analyst to take when deciding among investments. Important considerations include the relative concentration of assets and their similarity or heterogeneity as it concerns credit risk.

https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2022/pdf/introduction-alternative-investments.pdf,Introduction to Alternative Investments,2023,Level I,"In this section, we explain what alternative investments are and why assets under management in alternative investments have grown in recent decades. We also explain how alternative investments differ from traditional investments, and we examine their perceived investment merit. We conclude this section with a brief overview of the various categories of alternative investments; these categories will be explored further in later sections. “Alternative investments” is a label for a disparate group of investments that are distinguished from long-only, publicly traded investments in stocks, bonds, and cash (often referred to as traditional investments). The terms “traditional” and “alternative” should not imply that alternatives are necessarily uncommon or that they are relatively recent additions to the investment universe. Alternative investments include such assets as real estate and commodities, which are arguably two of the oldest types of investments. Alternative investments also include non-traditional approaches to investing within special vehicles, such as private equity funds and hedge funds. These funds may give the manager flexibility to use derivatives and leverage, to make investments in illiquid assets, and to take short positions. The assets in which these vehicles invest can include traditional assets (stocks, bonds, and cash) as well as less traditional assets. Management of alternative investments is typically active. Alternative investments often have many of the following characteristics: Narrow specialization of the investment managers Relatively low correlation of returns with those of traditional investments Less regulation and less transparency than traditional investments Limited historical risk and return data Unique legal and tax considerations Higher fees, often including performance or incentive fees Concentrated portfolios Restrictions on redemptions (i.e., “lockups” and “gates”)","The member should be able to: describe types and categories of alternative investments; describe characteristics of direct investment, co-investment, and fund investment methods for alternative investments; describe investment and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments; explain investment characteristics of hedge funds; explain investment characteristics of private capital; explain investment characteristics of natural resources; explain investment characteristics of real estate; explain investment characteristics of infrastructure; describe issues in performance appraisal of alternative investments; calculate and interpret returns of alternative investments on both before-fee and after-fee bases.","This reading provides a comprehensive introduction to alternative investments. Some key points of the reading are as follows: Alternative investments are supplemental strategies to traditional long-only positions in stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments include investments in five main categories: hedge funds, private capital, natural resources, real estate, and infrastructure. Alternative investment strategies are typically active, return-seeking strategies that also often have risk characteristics different from those of traditional long-only investments. Characteristics common to many alternative investments, when compared with traditional investments, include the following: lower liquidity, less regulation, lower transparency, higher fees, and limited and potentially problematic historical risk and return data. Alternative investments often have complex legal and tax considerations and may be highly leveraged. Alternative investments are attractive to investors because of the potential for portfolio diversification resulting in a higher risk-adjusted return for the portfolio. Investors can access alternative invests in three ways: Fund investment (such as a in a PE fund) Direct investment into a company or project (such as infrastructure or real estate) Co-investment into a portfolio company of a fund Investors conduct due diligence prior to investing in alternative investments. The due diligence approach depends on the investment method (direct, co-investing, or fund investing). Operational, financial, counterparty, and liquidity risks may be key considerations for those investing in alternative investments. These risks can be analyzed during the due diligence process. It is critical to perform fund due diligence to assess whether (a) the manager can effectively pursue the proposed investment strategy; (b) the appropriate organizational structure and policies for managing investments, operations, risk, and compliance are in place; and (c) the fund terms appear reasonable. Many alternative investments, such as hedge and private equity funds, use a partnership structure with a general partner that manages the business and limited partners (investors) who own fractional interests in the partnership. The general partner typically receives a management fee based on assets under management or committed capital (the former is common to hedge funds, and the latter is common to private equity funds) and an incentive fee based on realized profits. Hurdle rates, high-water marks, lockup and notice periods, and clawback provisions are often specified in the LPA. The fee structure affects the returns to investors (limited partners), with a waterfall representing the distribution method under which allocations are made to LPs and GPs. Waterfalls can be on a whole-of-fund basis (European) or deal-by-deal basis (American). Hedge funds are typically classified by strategy. One such classification includes four broad categories of strategies: equity hedge (e.g., market neutral), event driven (e.g., merger arbitrage), relative value (e.g., convertible bond arbitrage), macro and CTA strategies (e.g., commodity trading advisers). Funds-of-hedge-funds are funds that create a diversified portfolio of hedge funds. These vehicles are attractive to smaller investors that don’t have the resources to select individual hedge funds and build a portfolio of them. Private Capital is a broad term for funding provided to companies that is sourced from neither the public equity nor debt markets. Capital that is provided in the form of equity investments is called private equity, whereas capital that is provided as a loan or other form of debt is called private debt. Private equity refers to investment in privately owned companies or in public companies with the intent to take them private. Key private equity investment strategies include leveraged buyouts (e.g., MBOs and MBIs) and venture capital. Primary exit strategies include trade sale, IPO, and recapitalization. Private debt refers to various forms of debt provided by investors to private entities. Key private debt strategies include direct lending, mezzanine debt, and venture debt. Private debt also includes specialized strategies, such as CLOs, unitranche debt, real estate debt, and infrastructure debt. Natural resources include commodities (hard and soft), agricultural land (farmland), and timberland. Commodity investments may involve investing in actual physical commodities or in producers of commodities, but more typically, these investments are made using commodity derivatives (futures or swaps). One can also invest in commodities via a CTA (see hedge funds). Returns to commodity investing are based on changes in price and do not include an income stream, such as dividends, interest, or rent (apart from income earned on the collateral). However, timberland offers an income stream based on the sale of trees, wood, and other products. Timberland can be thought of as both a factory and a warehouse. Plus, timberland is a sustainable investment that mitigates climate-related risks. Farmland, like timberland, has an income component related to harvest quantities and agricultural commodity prices. However, farmland doesn’t have the production flexibility of timberland, because farm products must be harvested when ripe. Real estate includes two major sectors: residential and commercial. Residential real estate is the largest sector, making up some 75% of the market globally. Commercial real estate primarily includes office buildings, shopping centers, and warehouses. Real estate property has some unique features compared with other asset classes, including heterogeneity (no two properties are identical) and fixed location. Real estate investments can be direct or indirect, in the public market (e.g., REITs) or private transactions, and in equity or debt. The assets underlying infrastructure investments are real, capital intensive, and long lived. These assets are intended for public use, and they provide essential services. Examples include airports, health care facilities, and power plants. Funding is often done on a public–private partnership basis. Social infrastructure assets are directed toward human activities and include such assets as educational, health care, social housing, and correctional facilities, with the focus on providing, operating, and maintaining the asset infrastructure. Infrastructure investments may also be categorized by the underlying asset’s stage of development. Investing in infrastructure assets that are to be constructed is generally referred to as greenfield investment. Investing in existing infrastructure assets may be referred to as brownfield investment. Conducting performance appraisal on alternative investments can be challenging because these investments are often characterized by asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures. Traditional risk and return measures (such as mean return, standard deviation of returns, and beta) may provide an inadequate picture of alternative investments’ risk and return characteristics. Moreover, these measures may be unreliable or not representative of specific investments. A variety of ratios can be calculated in order to review the performance of alternative investments, including the Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Treynor ratio, Calmar ratio, and MAR ratio. In addition, batting average and slugging percentage can also be used. The IRR calculation is often used to evaluate private equity investments, and the cap rate is often used to evaluate real estate investments. Redemption rules and lockup periods can bring special challenges to performance appraisal of alternative investments. When comparing the performance of alternative investments versus an index, the analyst must be aware that indexes for alternative investments may be subject to a variety of biases, including survivorship and backfill biases. Analysts need to be aware of any custom fee arrangements in place that will affect the calculation of fees and performance. These can include such arrangements as fee discounts based on custom liquidity terms or significant asset size; special share classes, such as “founders’ shares”; and a departure from the typical management fee + performance fee structure in favor of “either/or” fees.

We explore basic definitions of such instruments, explain the main concepts, cover elements of valuation and pricing, and discuss applications.","The member should be able to: describe credit default swaps (CDS), single-name and index CDS, and the parameters that define a given CDS product; describe credit events and settlement protocols with respect to CDS; explain the principles underlying and factors that influence the market’s pricing of CDS; describe the use of CDS to manage credit exposures and to express views regarding changes in the shape and/or level of the credit curve; describe the use of CDS to take advantage of valuation disparities among separate markets, such as bonds, loans, equities, and equity-linked instruments.","A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract between two parties in which one party purchases protection from another party against losses from the default of a borrower for a defined period of time. A CDS is written on the debt of a third party, called the reference entity, whose relevant debt is called the reference obligation, typically a senior unsecured bond. A CDS written on a particular reference obligation normally provides coverage for all obligations of the reference entity that have equal or higher seniority. The two parties to the CDS are the credit protection buyer, who is said to be short the reference entity’s credit, and the credit protection seller, who is said to be long the reference entity’s credit. The CDS pays off upon occurrence of a credit event, which includes bankruptcy, failure to pay, and, in some countries, involuntary restructuring. Settlement of a CDS can occur through a cash payment from the credit protection seller to the credit protection buyer as determined by the cheapest-to-deliver obligation of the reference entity or by physical delivery of the reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller in exchange for the CDS notional. A cash settlement payoff is determined by an auction of the reference entity’s debt, which gives the market’s assessment of the likely recovery rate. The credit protection buyer must accept the outcome of the auction even though the ultimate recovery rate could differ. CDS can be constructed on a single entity or as indexes containing multiple entities. Bespoke CDS or baskets of CDS are also common. The fixed payments made from CDS buyer to CDS seller are customarily set at a fixed annual rate of 1% for investment-grade debt or 5% for high-yield debt. Valuation of a CDS is determined by estimating the present value of the payment leg, which is the series of payments made from the protection buyer to the protection seller, and the present value of the protection leg, which is the payment from the protection seller to the protection buyer in event of default. If the present value of the payment leg is greater than the present value of the protection leg, the protection buyer pays an upfront premium to the seller. If the present value of the protection leg is greater than the present value of the payment leg, the seller pays an upfront premium to the buyer. An important determinant of the value of the expected payments is the hazard rate, the probability of default given that default has not already occurred. CDS prices are often quoted in terms of credit spreads, the implied number of basis points that the credit protection seller receives from the credit protection buyer to justify providing the protection. Credit spreads are often expressed in terms of a credit curve, which expresses the relationship between the credit spreads on bonds of different maturities for the same borrower. CDS change in value over their lives as the credit quality of the reference entity changes, which leads to gains and losses for the counterparties, even though default may not have occurred or may never occur. CDS spreads approach zero as the CDS approaches maturity. Either party can monetize an accumulated gain or loss by entering into an offsetting position that matches the terms of the original CDS. CDS are used to increase or decrease credit exposures or to capitalize on different assessments of the cost of credit among different instruments tied to the reference entity, such as debt, equity, and derivatives of debt and equity.

Contingent claims include options, the valuation of which is the objective of this reading. Because many investments contain embedded options, understanding this material is vital for investment management. Our primary purpose is to understand how the values of options are determined. Option values, as with the values of all financial instruments, are typically obtained using valuation models. Any financial valuation model takes certain inputs and turns them into an output that tells us the fair value or price. Option valuation models, like their counterparts in the forward, futures, and swaps markets, are based on the principle of no arbitrage, meaning that the appropriate price of an option is the one that makes it impossible for any party to earn an arbitrage profit at the expense of any other party. The price that precludes arbitrage profits is the value of the option. Using that concept, we then proceed to introduce option valuation models using two approaches. The first approach is the binomial model, which is based on discrete time, and the second is the Black–Scholes–Merton (BSM) model, which is based on continuous time. The reading is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the principles of the no-arbitrage approach to pricing and valuation of options. In Section 3, the binomial option valuation model is explored, and in Section 4, the BSM model is covered. In Section 5, the Black model, being a variation of the BSM model, is applied to futures options, interest rate options, and swaptions. Finally, in Section 6, the Greeks are reviewed along with implied volatility. Section 7 provides a summary.",The member should be able to: describe and interpret the binomial option valuation model and its component terms; calculate the no-arbitrage values of European and American options using a two-period binomial model; identify an arbitrage opportunity involving options and describe the related arbitrage; calculate and interpret the value of an interest rate option using a two-period binomial model; describe how the value of a European option can be analyzed as the present value of the option’s expected payoff at expiration; identify assumptions of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model; interpret the components of the Black–Scholes–Merton model as applied to call options in terms of a leveraged position in the underlying; describe how the Black–Scholes–Merton model is used to value European options on equities and currencies; describe how the Black model is used to value European options on futures; describe how the Black model is used to value European interest rate options and European swaptions; interpret each of the option Greeks; describe how a delta hedge is executed; describe the role of gamma risk in options trading; define implied volatility and explain how it is used in options trading.,"This reading on the valuation of contingent claims provides a foundation for understanding how a variety of different options are valued. Key points include the following: The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money and do not take any price risk. The no-arbitrage approach is used for option valuation and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which says that if two investments have the same future cash flows regardless of what happens in the future, then these two investments should have the same current price. Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. The underlying instrument price follows a known distribution. Borrowing and lending is available at a known risk-free rate. The two-period binomial model can be viewed as three one-period binomial models, one positioned at Time 0 and two positioned at Time 1. In general, European-style options can be valued based on the expectations approach in which the option value is determined as the present value of the expected future option payouts, where the discount rate is the risk-free rate and the expectation is taken based on the risk-neutral probability measure. Both American-style options and European-style options can be valued based on the no-arbitrage approach, which provides clear interpretations of the component terms; the option value is determined by working backward through the binomial tree to arrive at the correct current value. For American-style options, early exercise influences the option values and hedge ratios as one works backward through the binomial tree. Interest rate option valuation requires the specification of an entire term structure of interest rates, so valuation is often estimated via a binomial tree. A key assumption of the Black–Scholes–Merton option valuation model is that the return of the underlying instrument follows geometric Brownian motion, implying a lognormal distribution of the return. The BSM model can be interpreted as a dynamically managed portfolio of the underlying instrument and zero-coupon bonds. BSM model interpretations related to N(d 1 ) are that it is the basis for the number of units of underlying instrument to replicate an option, that it is the primary determinant of delta, and that it answers the question of how much the option value will change for a small change in the underlying. BSM model interpretations related to N(d 2 ) are that it is the basis for the number of zero-coupon bonds to acquire to replicate an option and that it is the basis for estimating the risk-neutral probability of an option expiring in the money. The Black futures option model assumes the underlying is a futures or a forward contract. Interest rate options can be valued based on a modified Black futures option model in which the underlying is a forward rate agreement (FRA), there is an accrual period adjustment as well as an underlying notional amount, and that care must be given to day-count conventions. An interest rate cap is a portfolio of interest rate call options termed caplets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities. An interest rate floor is a portfolio of interest rate put options termed floorlets, each with the same exercise rate and with sequential maturities. A swaption is an option on a swap. A payer swaption is an option on a swap to pay fixed and receive floating. A receiver swaption is an option on a swap to receive fixed and pay floating. Long a callable fixed-rate bond can be viewed as long a straight fixed-rate bond and short a receiver swaption. Delta is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant. Delta hedging refers to managing the portfolio delta by entering additional positions into the portfolio. A delta neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio delta is set and maintained at zero. A change in the option price can be estimated with a delta approximation. Because delta is used to make a linear approximation of the non-linear relationship that exists between the option price and the underlying price, there is an error that can be estimated by gamma. Gamma is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio delta for a given small change in the value of the underlying instrument, holding everything else constant. Gamma captures the non-linearity risk or the risk—via exposure to the underlying—that remains once the portfolio is delta neutral. A gamma neutral portfolio is one in which the portfolio gamma is maintained at zero. The change in the option price can be better estimated by a delta-plus-gamma approximation compared with just a delta approximation. Theta is a static risk measure defined as the change in the value of an option given a small change in calendar time, holding everything else constant. Vega is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in volatility, holding everything else constant. Rho is a static risk measure defined as the change in a given portfolio for a given small change in the risk-free interest rate, holding everything else constant. Although historical volatility can be estimated, there is no objective measure of future volatility. Implied volatility is the BSM model volatility that yields the market option price. Implied volatility is a measure of future volatility, whereas historical volatility is a measure of past volatility. Option prices reflect the beliefs of option market participant about the future volatility of the underlying. The volatility smile is a two dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to the exercise price. The volatility surface is a three dimensional plot of the implied volatility with respect to both expiration time and exercise prices. If the BSM model assumptions were true, then one would expect to find the volatility surface flat, but in practice, the volatility surface is not flat.

Given that investment in commodities is conducted primarily through futures markets, the concepts and theories behind commodity futures is a primary focus of the reading. In particular, the relationship between spot and futures prices, as well as the underlying components of futures returns, are key analytical considerations. What do we mean when we talk about investing in commodities? A basic economic definition is that a commodity is a physical good attributable to a natural resource that is tradable and supplied without substantial differentiation by the general public. Commodities trade in physical (spot) markets and in futures and forward markets. Spot markets involve the physical transfer of goods between buyers and sellers; prices in these markets reflect current (or very near term) supply and demand conditions. Global commodity futures markets constitute financial exchanges of standardized futures contracts in which a price is established in the market today for the sale of some defined quantity and quality of a commodity at a future date of delivery; completion of the contract may permit cash settlement or require physical delivery. Commodity futures exchanges allow for risk transfer and provide a valuable price discovery mechanism that reflects the collective views of all market participants with regard to the future supply and demand prospects of a commodity. Given the financial (versus physical) nature of their contract execution, commodity exchanges allow important parties beyond traditional suppliers and buyers—speculators, arbitrageurs, private equity, endowments, and other institutional investors—to participate in these price discovery and risk transfer processes. Standardized contracts and organized exchanges also offer liquidity (i.e., trading volumes) to facilitate closing, reducing, expanding, or opening new hedges or exposures as circumstances change on a daily basis. Forward markets exist alongside futures markets in certain commodities for use by entities that require customization in contract terms. Forwards are largely outside the scope of this reading and are discussed only briefly. Exposure to commodities is also traded in the swap markets for both speculative and hedging purposes. Investment managers may want to establish swap positions to match certain portfolio needs, whereas producers may want to more precisely adjust their commodity risk (e.g., the origin of their cattle or the chemical specifications of their crude oil). Commodities offer the potential for diversification benefits in a multi-asset class portfolio because of historically low average return correlation with stocks and bonds. In addition, certain academic studies (e.g., Gorton and Rouwenhorst 2006; Erb and Harvey 2006) demonstrate that some commodities have historically had inflation hedging qualities. Our coverage of the commodities topic is organized as follows: We provide an overview of physical commodity markets, including the major sectors, their life cycles, and their valuation. We then describe futures market participants, commodity futures pricing, and the analysis of commodity returns, including the concepts of contango and backwardation. The subsequent section reviews the use of swap instruments rather than futures to gain exposure to commodities. We then review the various commodity indexes given their importance as benchmarks for the asset class and investment vehicles. Finally, we conclude with a summary of the major points.","The member should be able to: compare characteristics of commodity sectors; compare the life cycle of commodity sectors from production through trading or consumption; contrast the valuation of commodities with the valuation of equities and bonds; describe types of participants in commodity futures markets; analyze the relationship between spot prices and futures prices in markets in contango and markets in backwardation; compare theories of commodity futures returns; describe, calculate, and interpret the components of total return for a fully collateralized commodity futures contract; contrast roll return in markets in contango and markets in backwardation; describe how commodity swaps are used to obtain or modify exposure to commodities; describe how the construction of commodity indexes affects index returns.","Commodities are a diverse asset class comprising various sectors: energy, grains, industrial (base) metals, livestock, precious metals, and softs (cash crops). Each of these sectors has a number of characteristics that are important in determining the supply and demand for each commodity, including ease of storage, geopolitics, and weather. Fundamental analysis of commodities relies on analyzing supply and demand for each of the products as well as estimating the reaction to the inevitable shocks to their equilibrium or underlying direction. The life cycle of commodities varies considerably depending on the economic, technical, and structural (i.e., industry, value chain) profile of each commodity as well as the sector. A short life cycle allows for relatively rapid adjustment to outside events, whereas a long life cycle generally limits the ability of the market to react. The valuation of commodities relative to that of equities and bonds can be summarized by noting that equities and bonds represent financial assets whereas commodities are physical assets. The valuation of commodities is not based on the estimation of future profitability and cash flows but rather on a discounted forecast of future possible prices based on such factors as the supply and demand of the physical item. The commodity trading environment is similar to other asset classes, with three types of trading participants: (1) informed investors/hedgers, (2) speculators, and (3) arbitrageurs. Commodities have two general pricing forms: spot prices in the physical markets and futures prices for later delivery. The spot price is the current price to deliver or purchase a physical commodity at a specific location. A futures price is an exchange-based price agreed on to deliver or receive a defined quantity and often quality of a commodity at a future date. The difference between spot and futures prices is generally called the basis. When the spot price is higher than the futures price, it is called backwardation, and when it is lower, it is called contango. Backwardation and contango are also used to describe the relationship between two futures contracts of the same commodity. Commodity contracts can be settled by either cash or physical delivery. There are three primary theories of futures returns. In insurance theory, commodity producers who are long the physical good are motived to sell the commodity for future delivery to hedge their production price risk exposure. The hedging pressure hypothesis describes when producers along with consumers seek to protect themselves from commodity market price volatility by entering into price hedges to stabilize their projected profits and cash flow. The theory of storage focuses on supply and demand dynamics of commodity inventories, including the concept of “convenience yield.” The total return of a fully collateralized commodity futures contract can be quantified as the spot price return plus the roll return plus the collateral return (risk-free rate return). The roll return is effectively the weighted accounting difference (in percentage terms) between the near-term commodity futures contract price and the farther-term commodity futures contract price. A commodity swap is a legal contract between two parties calling for the exchange of payments over multiple dates as determined by several reference prices or indexes. The most relevant commodity swaps include excess return swaps, total return swaps, basis swaps, and variance/volatility swaps. The five primary commodity indexes based on assets are (1) the S&P GSCI; (2) the Bloomberg Commodity Index, formerly the Dow Jones–UBS Commodity Index; (3) the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index; (4) the Thomson Reuters/CoreCommodity CRB Index; and (5) the Rogers International Commodities Index. The key differentiating characteristics of commodity indexes are the breadth and selection methodology of coverage (number of commodities and sectors) included in each index, noting that some commodities have multiple reference contracts, the relative weightings assigned to each component/commodity and the related methodology for how these weights are determined, the methodology and frequency for rolling the individual futures contracts, the methodology and frequency for rebalancing the weights of the individual commodities and sectors, and the governance that determines which commodities are selected.

https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/protected/refresher-reading/2023/RR-2023-L1V3R1-understanding-income-statements.pdf,Understanding Income Statements,2023,Level I,"The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time. The income statement communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue. The basic equation underlying the income statement, ignoring gains and losses, is Revenue minus Expenses equals Net income. The income statement is also sometimes referred to as the “statement of operations,” “statement of earnings,” or “profit and loss (P&L) statement.” Under both International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), the income statement may be presented as a separate statement followed by a statement of comprehensive income that begins with the profit or loss from the income statement or as a section of a single statement of comprehensive income. This reading focuses on the income statement, and the term income statement will be used to describe either the separate statement that reports profit or loss used for earnings per share calculations or that section of a statement of comprehensive income that reports the same profit or loss. The reading also includes a discussion of comprehensive income (profit or loss from the income statement plus other comprehensive income). Investment analysts intensely scrutinize companies’ income statements. Equity analysts are interested in them because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively, and because inputs into valuation models often include estimates of earnings. Fixed-income analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information on companies’ abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize information reported in income statements, particularly earnings, more than information reported in the other financial statements. This reading is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the components of the income statement and its format. Section 3 describes basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of revenue, and Section 4 describes basic principles and selected applications related to the recognition of expenses. Section 5 covers non-recurring items and non-operating items. Section 6 explains the calculation of earnings per share. Section 7 introduces income statement analysis, and Section 8 explains comprehensive income and its reporting. A summary of the key points and practice problems in the CFA Institute multiple choice format complete the reading.","The member should be able to: describe the components of the income statement and alternative presentation formats of that statement; Describe general principles of revenue recognition and accounting standards for revenue recognition; calculate revenue given information that might influence the choice of revenue recognition method; describe general principles of expense recognition, specific expense recognition applications, and implications of expense recognition choices for financial analysis; describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies; distinguish between the operating and non-operating components of the income statement; describe how earnings per share is calculated and calculate and interpret a company’s earnings per share (both basic and diluted earnings per share) for both simple and complex capital structures; distinguish between dilutive and antidilutive securities and describe the implications of each for the earnings per share calculation; convert income statements to common-size income statements; evaluate a company’s financial performance using common-size income statements and financial ratios based on the income statement; describe, calculate, and interpret comprehensive income; describe other comprehensive income and identify major types of items included in it.","This reading has presented the elements of income statement analysis. The income statement presents information on the financial results of a company’s business activities over a period of time; it communicates how much revenue the company generated during a period and what costs it incurred in connection with generating that revenue. A company’s net income and its components (e.g., gross margin, operating earnings, and pretax earnings) are critical inputs into both the equity and credit analysis processes. Equity analysts are interested in earnings because equity markets often reward relatively high- or low-earnings growth companies with above-average or below-average valuations, respectively. Fixed-income analysts examine the components of income statements, past and projected, for information on companies’ abilities to make promised payments on their debt over the course of the business cycle. Corporate financial announcements frequently emphasize income statements more than the other financial statements. Key points to this reading include the following: The income statement presents revenue, expenses, and net income. The components of the income statement include: revenue; cost of sales; sales, general, and administrative expenses; other operating expenses; non-operating income and expenses; gains and losses; non-recurring items; net income; and EPS. An income statement that presents a subtotal for gross profit (revenue minus cost of goods sold) is said to be presented in a multi-step format. One that does not present this subtotal is said to be presented in a single-step format. Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned, which may or may not be in the same period as the related cash collection. Recognition of revenue when earned is a fundamental principal of accrual accounting. An analyst should identify differences in companies’ revenue recognition methods and adjust reported revenue where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the revenue recognition as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about profitability. As of the beginning of 2018, revenue recognition standards have converged. The core principle of the converged standards is that revenue should be recognized to “depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in an exchange for those goods or services.” To achieve the core principle, the standard describes the application of five steps in recognizing revenue. The standard also specifies the treatment of some related contract costs and disclosure requirements. The general principles of expense recognition include a process to match expenses either to revenue (such as, cost of goods sold) or to the time period in which the expenditure occurs (period costs such as, administrative salaries) or to the time period of expected benefits of the expenditures (such as, depreciation). In expense recognition, choice of method (i.e., depreciation method and inventory cost method), as well as estimates (i.e., uncollectible accounts, warranty expenses, assets’ useful life, and salvage value) affect a company’s reported income. An analyst should identify differences in companies’ expense recognition methods and adjust reported financial statements where possible to facilitate comparability. Where the available information does not permit adjustment, an analyst can characterize the policies and estimates as more or less conservative and thus qualitatively assess how differences in policies might affect financial ratios and judgments about companies’ performance. To assess a company’s future earnings, it is helpful to separate those prior years’ items of income and expense that are likely to continue in the future from those items that are less likely to continue. Under IFRS, a company should present additional line items, headings, and subtotals beyond those specified when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. Some items from prior years clearly are not expected to continue in future periods and are separately disclosed on a company’s income statement. Under US GAAP, unusual and/or infrequently occurring items, which are material, are presented separately within income from continuing operations. Non-operating items are reported separately from operating items on the income statement. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, the income statement reports separately the effect of the disposal of a component operation as a “discontinued” operation. Basic EPS is the amount of income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding over a period. The amount of income available to common shareholders is the amount of net income remaining after preferred dividends (if any) have been paid. If a company has a simple capital structure (i.e., one with no potentially dilutive securities), then its basic EPS is equal to its diluted EPS. If, however, a company has dilutive securities, its diluted EPS is lower than its basic EPS. Diluted EPS is calculated using the if-converted method for convertible securities and the treasury stock method for options. Common-size analysis of the income statement involves stating each line item on the income statement as a percentage of sales. Common-size statements facilitate comparison across time periods and across companies of different sizes. Two income-statement-based indicators of profitability are net profit margin and gross profit margin. Comprehensive income includes both net income and other revenue and expense items that are excluded from the net income calculation.

A forward contract is a promise to buy or sell an asset at a future date at a price agreed to at the contract’s initiation. The forward contract has a linear payoff function, with both upside and downside risk. A swap is essentially a promise to undertake a transaction at a set price or rate at several dates in the future. The technique we use to price and value swaps is to identify and construct a portfolio with cash flows equivalent to those of the swap. Then, we can use tools, such as the law of one price, to determine swap values from simpler financial instruments, such as a pair of bonds with a cash flow pattern similar to those of our swap. Look out for the big picture: value additivity, arbitrage, and the law of one price are important valuation concepts. Forwards and swaps are widely used in practice to manage a broad range of market risks. As well, more complex derivative instruments can sometimes be understood in terms of their basic building blocks: forwards and option-based components. Here are just some of the many and varied uses for forwards, futures, and swaps that you might encounter in your investment career: Use of equity index futures and swaps by a private wealth manager to hedge equity risk in a low tax basis, concentrated position in his high-net-worth client’s portfolio. Use of interest rate swaps by a defined benefits plan manager to hedge interest rate risk and to manage the pension plan’s duration gap. Use of derivatives (total return swaps, equity futures, bond futures, etc.) overlays by a university endowment for tactical asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. Use of interest rate swaps by a corporate borrower to synthetically convert floating-rate debt securities to fixed-rate debt securities (or vice versa). Use of VIX futures and inflation swaps by a firm’s market strategist to infer expectations about market volatility and inflation rates, respectively.","The member should be able to: describe the carry arbitrage model without underlying cashflows and with underlying cashflows; describe how equity forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how interest rate forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how fixed-income forwards and futures are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how interest rate swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how currency swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value; describe how equity swaps are priced, and calculate and interpret their no-arbitrage value.","This reading on forward commitment pricing and valuation provides a foundation for understanding how forwards, futures, and swaps are both priced and valued. Key points include the following: The arbitrageur would rather have more money than less and abides by two fundamental rules: Do not use your own money, and do not take any price risk. The no-arbitrage approach is used for the pricing and valuation of forward commitments and is built on the key concept of the law of one price, which states that if two investments have the same future cash flows, regardless of what happens in the future, these two investments should have the same current price. Throughout this reading, the following key assumptions are made: Replicating and offsetting instruments are identifiable and investable. Market frictions are nil. Short selling is allowed with full use of proceeds. Borrowing and lending are available at a known risk-free rate. Carry arbitrage models used for forward commitment pricing and valuation are based on the no-arbitrage approach. With forward commitments, there is a distinct difference between pricing and valuation. Pricing involves the determination of the appropriate fixed price or rate, and valuation involves the determination of the contract’s current value expressed in currency units. Forward commitment pricing results in determining a price or rate such that the forward contract value is equal to zero. Using the carry arbitrage model, the forward contract price (F 0 ) is: F 0 = FV(S 0 ) = S 0 (1 + r) T (assuming annual compounding, r) F 0 = FV ( S 0 ) = S 0 exp r c T (assuming continuous compounding, r c ) The key forward commitment pricing equations with carry costs (CC) and carry benefits (CB) are: F 0 = FV[S 0 + CC 0 – CB 0 ] (with discrete compounding) F 0 = S 0 exp ( r c + CC − CB ) T (with continuous compounding) Futures contract pricing in this reading can essentially be treated the same as forward contract pricing. The value of a forward commitment is a function of the price of the underlying instrument, financing costs, and other carry costs and benefits. The key forward commitment valuation equations are: Long Forward: V t = PV [ F t − F 0 ] = [ F t − F 0 ] ( 1 + r ) T − t and Short Forward: − V t = PV [ F 0 − F t ] = [ F 0 − F t ] ( 1 + r ) T − t , With the PV of the difference in forward prices adjusted for carry costs and benefits. Alternatively, Long Forward: V t = S t − P V [ F 0 ] = S t − F 0 ( 1 + r ) T − t and Short Forward: − V t = PV [ F 0 ] − S t = F 0 ( 1 + r ) T − t − S t With equities and fixed-income securities, the forward price is determined such that the initial forward value is zero. A forward rate agreement (FRA) is a forward contract on interest rates. The FRA’s fixed interest rate is determined such that the initial value of the FRA is zero. FRA settlements amounts at Time h are: Pay-fixed (Long): NA × {[L m – FRA 0 ] t m }/[1 + D m t m ] and Receive-fixed (Short): NA × {FRA 0 – L m ] t m }/[1 + D m t m ]. The FRA’s fixed interest rate (annualized) at contract initiation is: FRA 0 = {[1 + L T t T ]/[1 + L h t h ] – 1}/t m . The Time g value of an FRA initiated at Time 0 is: Long FRA: V g = NA × {[FRA g – FRA 0 ] t m }/[1+ D (T–g) t (T–g) ] and Short FRA: –V g = NA × {[FRA 0 – FRA g ] t m }/[1+ D (T–g) t (T–g) ]. The fixed-income forward (or futures) price including conversion factor (i.e., adjusted price) is: F 0 = Q 0 × CF = FV[S 0 + CC 0 – CB 0 ] = FV[B 0 + AI 0 – PVCI], and the conversion factor adjusted futures price (i.e., quoted futures price) is: Q 0 = [1/CF] {FV [B 0 + AI 0 ] – AI T – FVCI}. The general approach to pricing and valuing swaps as covered here is using a replicating portfolio or offsetting portfolio of comparable instruments, typically bonds for interest rate and currency swaps and equities plus bonds for equity swaps. The swap pricing equation, which sets r FIX for the implied fixed bond in an interest rate swap, is: r F I X = 1 − PV n ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) . The value of an interest rate swap at a point in Time t after initiation is the sum of the present values of the difference in fixed swap rates times the stated notional amount, or: V S W A P , t = NA × ( FS 0 − FS t ) × ∑ i = 1 n PV i (Value of receive-fixed swap) and − V S W A P , t = NA × ( FS t − FS 0 ) × ∑ i = 1 n PV i (Value of pay-fixed swap). With a basic understanding of pricing and valuing a simple interest rate swap, it is a straightforward extension to pricing and valuing currency swaps and equity swaps. The solution for each of the three variables, one notional amount (NA a ) and two fixed rates (one for each currency, a and b), needed to price a fixed-for-fixed currency swap are : NA a = S 0 × NA b; r a = 1 − PV n , a ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i , a ( 1 ) and r b = 1 − PV n , b ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n PV i , b ( 1 ) . The currency swap valuation equation, for valuing the swap at time t (after initiation), can be expressed as: V C S = NA a ( r F i x , a ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) + PV n ( 1 ) ) − S t NA b ( r F i x , b ∑ i = 1 n PV i ( 1 ) + PV n ( 1 ) ) . For a receive-fixed, pay equity swap, the fixed rate (r FIX ) for the implied fixed bond that makes the swap’s value (V EQ ) equal to “0” at initiation is: r F I X = 1 − P V n ( 1 ) ∑ i = 1 n P V i ( 1 ) . The value of an equity swap at Time t (V EQ,t ), after initiation, is: V EQ,t = V FIX (C 0 ) – (S t /S t–1 )NA E – PV(Par – NA E ) where V FIX (C 0 ) is the Time t value of a fixed-rate bond initiated with coupon C 0 at Time 0, S t is the current equity price, S t–1 is the equity price at the last reset date, and PV() is the PV function from the swap maturity date to Time t.

And that’s just the equity portion. The use of debt means transaction value is often two or three times the actual equity raised. Blackstone, Carlyle, and KKR are household names and publicly traded companies of significant size. Private equity funds may account for 15%–18% of the value of all mergers and acquisitions, and the market capitalization of Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, and Google has raised the profile of venture capital investing. We take two approaches to illuminate our subject: In Section 2 the perspective is primarily that of the private equity firm evaluating potential investments. Valuing acquisitions is particularly complex; except for public-to-private transactions, there will be no market prices to refer to, and the challenges are considerable. In Section 3 we take the perspective of an outside investor investing in a fund sponsored by the private equity firm. Definitions of private equity differ, but here we include the entire asset class of equity investments that are not quoted on stock markets. Private equity stretches from venture capital (VC)—working with early-stage companies that may be without revenues but that possess good ideas or technology—to growth equity, providing capital to expand established private businesses often by taking a minority interest, all the way to large buyouts (leveraged buyouts, or LBOs), in which the private equity firm buys the entire company. When the target is publicly traded, the private equity fund performs a public-to-private transaction, removing the target from the stock market. But buyout transactions usually involve private companies and very often a particular division of an existing company. Some exclude venture capital from the private equity universe because of the higher risk profile of backing new companies as opposed to mature ones. For this reading, we refer simply to venture capital and buyouts as the two main forms of private equity. Many classifications of private equity are available. Classifications proposed by the European and Private Equity Venture Capital Association (EVCA) are displayed in Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1. Classification of Private Equity in Terms of Stage and Type of Financing of Portfolio Companies Broad Category Subcategory Brief Description Venture capital Seed stage Financing provided to research business ideas, develop prototype products, or conduct market research Start-up stage Financing to recently created companies with well-articulated business and marketing plans Later (expansion) stage Financing to companies that have started their selling effort and may already be covering costs: Financing may serve to expand production capacity, product development, or provide working capital. Replacement capital Financing provided to purchase shares from other existing venture capital investors or to reduce financial leverage. Growth Expansion capital Financing to established and mature companies in exchange for equity, often a minority stake, to expand into new markets and/or improve operations Buyout Acquisition capital Financing in the form of debt, equity, or quasi-equity provided to a company to acquire another company Leveraged buyout Financing provided by an LBO firm to acquire a company Management buyout Financing provided to the management to acquire a company, specific product line, or division (carve-out) Special situations Mezzanine finance Financing generally provided in the form of subordinated debt and an equity kicker (warrants, equity, etc.) frequently in the context of LBO transactions Distressed/turnaround Financing of companies in need of restructuring or facing financial distress One-time opportunities Financing in relation to changing industry trends and new government regulations Other Other forms of private equity financing are also possible—for example, activist investing, funds of funds, and secondaries. Private equity funds may also be classified geographically, by sector, or both. Certain specialists target real asset classes, such as real estate, infrastructure, energy, and timber, or they seek out emerging or niche sectors, such as agribusiness or royalties in pharmaceuticals, music, film, or TV. US private equity enjoyed a far larger market size historically than private equity in other regions, with few restrictions on hostile takeovers. Buyouts subsequently expanded to Europe and then Asia as friendly deals became commonplace. In broad terms, around four-fifths of the money has been flowing into buyout, growth, and other types of private equity in both the United States and Europe, with buyout amounts far exceeding other types. The sheer scale of buyouts means that an individual deal can absorb billions of dollars in capital. Buyout funds have benefited from increased allocations given their ability to absorb far higher capital amounts and to deliver historically higher-than-average returns. Venture capital deals, in contrast, tend to drip, providing small amounts of feed money. Still, advances in technology and communications are causing the number of venture capital funds and the availability of start-up capital to grow. Investor attention started to shift to China in 2015, an especially active year for raising capital. VC funds targeting Asia had more than US$200 billion in 2017, up from US$50 billion in 2010. Most private equity money comes from institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and insurance companies, although many family offices and high-net-worth individuals also invest directly or through fund-of-funds intermediaries. Venture capital investors include government agencies and corporations seeking to promote regional investment or gain insight into, and possibly control of, emerging businesses and technologies. Private equity investment is characterized by a buy-to-sell orientation: Investors typically expect their money to be returned, with a handsome profit, within 10 years of committing their funds. The economic incentives of the funds are aligned with this goal.","The member should be able to: explain sources of value creation in private equity; explain how private equity firms align their interests with those of the managers of portfolio companies; distinguish between the characteristics of buyout and venture capital investments; interpret LBO model and VC method output; explain alternative exit routes in private equity and their impact on value; explain risks and costs of investing in private equity; explain private equity fund structures, terms, due diligence, and valuation in the context of an analysis of private equity fund returns; interpret and compare financial performance of private equity funds from the perspective of an investor; calculate management fees, carried interest, net asset value, distributed to paid in (DPI), residual value to paid in (RVPI), and total value to paid in (TVPI) of a private equity fund.","Private equity funds seek to add value by various means, including optimizing financial structures, incentivizing management, and creating operational improvements. Private equity can be thought of as an alternative system of governance for corporations: Rather than ownership and control being separated as in most publicly quoted companies, private equity concentrates ownership and control. Many view the combination of ownership and control as a fundamental source of the returns earned by the best private equity funds. A critical role for the GP is valuation of potential investments. But because these investments are usually privately owned, valuation encounters many challenges. Valuation techniques differ according to the nature of the investment. Early-stage ventures require very different techniques than leveraged buyouts. Private equity professionals tend to use multiple techniques when performing a valuation, and they explore many different scenarios for the future development of the business. In buyouts, the availability of debt financing can have a big impact on the scale of private equity activity, and it seems to impact valuations observed in the market. Because private equity funds are incentivized to acquire, add value, and then exit within the lifetime of the fund, they are considered buy-to-sell investors. Planning the exit route for the investment is a critical role for the GP, and a well-timed and well-executed investment can be a significant source of realized value. In addition to the problems encountered by the private equity funds in valuing potential portfolio investments, challenges exist in valuing the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis. This is because the investments have no easily observed market value and there is a large element of judgment involved in valuing each of the portfolio companies prior to their sale by the fund. The two main metrics for measuring the ongoing and ultimate performance of private equity funds are IRR and multiples. Comparisons of PE returns across funds and with other assets are demanding because it is important to control for the timing of cash flows, differences in risk and portfolio composition, and vintage-year effects.

Valuation becomes more complicated when a bond has one or more embedded options because the values of embedded options are typically contingent on interest rates. Understanding how to value and analyze bonds with embedded options is important for practitioners. Issuers of bonds often manage interest rate exposure with embedded options, such as call provisions. Investors in callable bonds must appreciate the risk of being called. The perception of this risk is collectively represented by the premium, in terms of increased coupon or yield, that the market demands for callable bonds relative to otherwise identical option-free bonds. Issuers and investors must also understand how other types of embedded options—such as put provisions, conversion options, caps, and floors—affect bond values and the sensitivity of these bonds to interest rate movements. We first provide a brief overview of various types of embedded options. We then discuss bonds that include a call or put provision. Taking a building-block approach, we show how the arbitrage-free valuation framework discussed earlier can be applied to the valuation of callable and putable bonds—first in the absence of interest rate volatility, and then when interest rates fluctuate. We also discuss how option-adjusted spreads are used to value risky callable and putable bonds. We then turn to interest rate sensitivity. It highlights the need to use effective duration, including one-sided durations and key rate durations, as well as effective convexity to assess the effect of interest rate movements on the value of callable and putable bonds. We also explain the valuation of capped and floored floating-rate bonds (floaters) and convertible bonds.","The member should be able to: describe fixed-income securities with embedded options; explain the relationships between the values of a callable or putable bond, the underlying option-free (straight) bond, and the embedded option; describe how the arbitrage-free framework can be used to value a bond with embedded options; explain how interest rate volatility affects the value of a callable or putable bond; explain how changes in the level and shape of the yield curve affect the value of a callable or putable bond; calculate the value of a callable or putable bond from an interest rate tree; explain the calculation and use of option-adjusted spreads; explain how interest rate volatility affects option-adjusted spreads; calculate and interpret effective duration of a callable or putable bond; compare effective durations of callable, putable, and straight bonds; describe the use of one-sided durations and key rate durations to evaluate the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options; compare effective convexities of callable, putable, and straight bonds; calculate the value of a capped or floored floating-rate bond; describe defining features of a convertible bond; calculate and interpret the components of a convertible bond’s value; describe how a convertible bond is valued in an arbitrage-free framework; compare the risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond with the risk–return characteristics of a straight bond and of the underlying common stock.","An embedded option represents a right that can be exercised by the issuer, by the bondholder, or automatically depending on the course of interest rates. It is attached to, or embedded in, an underlying option-free bond called a straight bond. Simple embedded option structures include call options, put options, and extension options. Callable and putable bonds can be redeemed prior to maturity, at the discretion of the issuer in the former case and of the bondholder in the latter case. An extendible bond gives the bondholder the right to keep the bond for a number of years after maturity. Putable and extendible bonds are equivalent, except that their underlying option-free bonds are different. Complex embedded option structures include bonds with other types of options or combinations of options. For example, a convertible bond includes a conversion option that allows the bondholders to convert their bonds into the issuer’s common stock. A bond with an estate put can be put by the heirs of a deceased bondholder. Sinking fund bonds make the issuer set aside funds over time to retire the bond issue and are often callable, may have an acceleration provision, and may also contain a delivery option. Valuing and analyzing bonds with complex embedded option structures is challenging. According to the arbitrage-free framework, the value of a bond with an embedded option is equal to the arbitrage-free values of its parts—that is, the arbitrage-free value of the straight bond and the arbitrage-free values of each of the embedded options. Because the call option is an issuer option, the value of the call option decreases the value of the callable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-callable bond. In contrast, because the put option is an investor option, the value of the put option increases the value of the putable bond relative to an otherwise identical but non-putable bond. In the absence of default and interest rate volatility, the bond’s future cash flows are certain. Thus, the value of a callable or putable bond can be calculated by discounting the bond’s future cash flows at the appropriate one-period forward rates, taking into consideration the decision to exercise the option. If a bond is callable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the issuer, which will exercise the call option when the value of the bond’s future cash flows is higher than the call price. In contrast, if the bond is putable, the decision to exercise the option is made by the bondholder, who will exercise the put option when the value of the bond’s future cash flows is lower than the put price. In practice, interest rates fluctuate and interest rate volatility affects the value of embedded options. Thus, when valuing bonds with embedded options, it is important to consider the possible evolution of the yield curve over time. Interest rate volatility is modeled using a binomial interest rate tree. The higher the volatility, the lower the value of the callable bond and the higher the value of the putable bond. Valuing a bond with embedded options assuming an interest rate volatility requires three steps: (1) Generate a tree of interest rates based on the given yield curve and volatility assumptions; (2) at each node of the tree, determine whether the embedded options will be exercised; and (3) apply the backward induction valuation methodology to calculate the present value of the bond. The option-adjusted spread is the single spread added uniformly to the one-period forward rates on the tree to produce a value or price for a bond. OAS is sensitive to interest rate volatility: The higher the volatility, the lower the OAS for a callable bond. For bonds with embedded options, the best measure to assess the sensitivity of the bond’s price to a parallel shift of the benchmark yield curve is effective duration. The effective duration of a callable or putable bond cannot exceed that of the straight bond. When the option is near the money, the convexity of a callable bond is negative, indicating that the upside for a callable bond is much smaller than the downside, whereas the convexity of a putable bond is positive, indicating that the upside for a putable bond is much larger than the downside. Because the prices of callable and putable bonds respond asymmetrically to upward and downward interest rate changes of the same magnitude, one-sided durations provide a better indication regarding the interest rate sensitivity of bonds with embedded options than (two-sided) effective duration. Key rate durations show the effect of shifting only key points, one at a time, rather than the entire yield curve. The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value capped and floored floaters. The cap provision in a floater is an issuer option that prevents the coupon rate from increasing above a specified maximum rate. Thus, the value of a capped floater is equal to or less than the value of the straight bond. In contrast, the floor provision in a floater is an investor option that prevents the coupon from decreasing below a specified minimum rate. Thus, the value of a floored floater is equal to or higher than the value of the straight bond. The characteristics of a convertible bond include the conversion price, which is the applicable share price at which the bondholders can convert their bonds into common shares, and the conversion ratio, which reflects the number of shares of common stock that the bondholders receive from converting their bonds into shares. The conversion price is adjusted in case of corporate actions, such as stock splits, bonus share issuances, and rights and warrants issuances. Convertible bondholders may receive compensation when the issuer pays dividends to its common shareholders, and they may be given the opportunity to either put their bonds or convert their bonds into shares earlier and at more advantageous terms in the case of a change of control. A number of investment metrics and ratios help analyze and value convertible bonds. The conversion value indicates the value of the bond if it is converted at the market price of the shares. The minimum value of a convertible bond sets a floor value for the convertible bond at the greater of the conversion value or the straight value. This floor is moving, however, because the straight value is not fixed. The market conversion premium represents the price investors effectively pay for the underlying shares if they buy the convertible bond and then convert it into shares. Scaled by the market price of the shares, it represents the premium payable when buying the convertible bond rather than the underlying common stock. Because convertible bonds combine characteristics of bonds, stocks, and options, as well as potentially other features, their valuation and analysis are challenging. Convertible bond investors should consider the factors that affect not only bond prices but also the underlying share price. The arbitrage-free framework can be used to value convertible bonds, including callable and putable ones. Each component (straight bond, call option of the stock, and call and/or put option on the bond) can be valued separately. The risk–return characteristics of a convertible bond depend on the underlying share price relative to the conversion price. When the underlying share price is well below the conversion price, the convertible bond is “busted” and exhibits mostly bond risk–return characteristics. Thus, it is mainly sensitive to interest rate movements. In contrast, when the underlying share price is well above the conversion price, the convertible bond exhibits mostly stock risk–return characteristics. Thus, its price follows similar movements to the price of the underlying stock. In between these two extremes, the convertible bond trades like a hybrid instrument.
